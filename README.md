# IEEE ICHI 2025
Repository used for the tutorial "Epidemic Modelling Frameworks for Studying Infectious Disease Dynamics" at the IEEE ICHI 2025 conference.

## TO CLONE THE REPOSITORY

```
git clone https://github.com/qBioTurin/IEEEICHI2025.git
```

### Contents

**Macro**
In this directory, you find:
-  A PDF with the instructions to install GreatSPN [1] on your PC, depending on the operating system.
-  The SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model used with Epimod [2]. In the README file, you will find a description of the model. 

**Micro**
In this directory, you will find the examples we use in the tutorial, as well as a user guide with all the details of the application [3].
