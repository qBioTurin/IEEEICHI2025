The SIR model is a straightforward compartmental model used to study the dynamics of infectious diseases. It divides the population into three key groups. The first group, susceptible (S), includes individuals who are vulnerable to the disease. When these individuals come into contact with infected people or share a confined space with them, they can contract the disease and transition to the infected group. The second group, infected (I), consists of individuals who are carrying the disease and can transmit it to those who are susceptible. The third group, recovered (R), includes individuals who have overcome the infection and gained immunity. Overall, the SIR model offers a simplified framework to analyze the spread of infectious diseases within a population, focusing on the interactions between the susceptible, infected, and recovered groups.
