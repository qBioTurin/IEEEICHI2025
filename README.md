# IEEE ICHI 2025
Repository used for the tutorial "Epidemic Modelling Frameworks for Studying Infectious Disease Dynamics" at the IEEE ICHI 2025 conference.

## TO CLONE THE REPOSITORY

```
git clone https://github.com/qBioTurin/IEEEICHI2025.git
```

### Contents
The slides used during the tutorial session are located in the main directory (Slides.pdf).

**Macro**  
This directory contains:
- A PDF with installation instructions for GreatSPN [1], tailored to your operating system.
- The SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) compartmental model used with Epimod [2] during the tutorial session. A description of the model is provided in the accompanying README file.

**Micro**  
This directory includes:
- The examples used in the tutorial session with Forge4Flame.
- A comprehensive user guide detailing how to use the application [3].

**From Macro to Micro**  
This directory contains the examples presented during the tutorial session, illustrating the connection between macro- and micro-level models.
