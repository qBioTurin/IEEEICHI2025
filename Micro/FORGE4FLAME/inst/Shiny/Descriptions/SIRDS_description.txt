The SIRDS model is an extension of the SIRD model, it inlcudes four compartments:

Susceptible (S): Represents the individuals who are susceptible to the disease. When a susceptible person comes into contact with infected individuals or share a closed space with infected individuals, he/she can contract the disease and move to the infected compartment.

Infected (I): Signifies the individuals who are infected and have the potential to transmit the disease to susceptible individuals.

Recovered (R): Encompasses individuals who have recovered from the infection and gained immunity.

Dead (D): Represents the individuals who have died from the disease.

The difference between SIRDS and SIRD is that individuals in the SIRDS model lose their immunity after a certain period of time, and become susceptible again.
