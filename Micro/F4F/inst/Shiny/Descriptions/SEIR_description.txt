The SEIR model is an extension of the SIR model that introduces a fourth compartment, providing a more detailed representation of disease dynamics. The first compartment, susceptible (S), includes individuals who are vulnerable to the disease. These individuals can contract the disease and transition to the exposed compartment when they come into contact with infected individuals or share a closed space with them. The second compartment, exposed (E), represents individuals who have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves. During this incubation period, they cannot transmit the disease to others. The third compartment, infected (I), consists of individuals who are actively infected and capable of transmitting the disease to susceptible individuals. The final compartment, recovered (R), includes individuals who have recovered from the infection and gained immunity. By accounting for the incubation period, the SEIR model offers a more refined framework for studying diseases with a latent phase before infectiousness.
