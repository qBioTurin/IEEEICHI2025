The SEIRDS model is an extension of the SEIRD model that introduces the possibility of waning immunity, adding a dynamic aspect to the compartmental framework. It includes five compartments. The first compartment, susceptible (S), represents individuals who are vulnerable to the disease. These individuals can contract the disease and transition to the exposed compartment upon contact with infected individuals or sharing a closed space with them. The second compartment, exposed (E), consists of individuals who have been infected but are in an incubation period, during which they cannot yet transmit the disease. The third compartment, infected (I), includes individuals who are actively infected and capable of spreading the disease to susceptible individuals. The fourth compartment, recovered (R), represents individuals who have overcome the infection and gained immunity. The fifth compartment, dead (D), accounts for individuals who have died as a result of the disease.

Unlike the SEIRD model, the SEIRDS model assumes that immunity is temporary. After a certain period, individuals in the recovered compartment lose their immunity and return to the susceptible compartment, re-entering the cycle. This feature makes the SEIRDS model particularly relevant for analyzing diseases where immunity wanes over time.
