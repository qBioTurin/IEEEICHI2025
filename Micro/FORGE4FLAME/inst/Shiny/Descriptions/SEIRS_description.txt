The SEIRS model is an extension of the SEIR model that incorporates the concept of temporary immunity, resulting in a cycle where individuals can return to susceptibility. It includes four compartments. The first compartment, susceptible (S), represents individuals who are vulnerable to the disease. When these individuals come into contact with infected individuals or share a confined space with them, they can contract the disease and transition to the exposed compartment. The second compartment, exposed (E), includes individuals who have been infected but are in an incubation period during which they cannot yet transmit the disease. The third compartment, infected (I), comprises individuals who are actively infected and capable of spreading the disease to susceptible individuals. The fourth compartment, recovered (R), consists of individuals who have overcome the infection and gained immunity.

In contrast to the SEIR model, the SEIRS model assumes that immunity is temporary. After a certain period, individuals in the recovered compartment lose their immunity and return to the susceptible compartment, making the SEIRS model particularly suitable for studying diseases where immunity wanes over time.
